# Anastellos Engine

[![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/A1Asriel/anastellos?label=Latest%20release&logo=Python&logoColor=DDDDDD&style=plastic)](https://github.com/A1Asriel/anastellos/releases/latest/)

Formerly the AsrielBot's soul, now is used as a modular universal Discord bot engine. It provides easy methods to manage the internals of any bot, as well as some predefined basic commands.

## Quick start (WIP)

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/A1Asriel/anastellos/releases/latest/).
2. Create a directory and extract the archive into the subdirectory `./anastellos`.
3. Move all files from `./anastellos/_dist` to the parent directory.
4. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the parent directory to install the dependencies.
5. Create `token.txt` and insert your bot token into the file.
6. Run `main.py` with your Python interpreter, and close it after it boots up.
7. Tweak the stuff in `config.json` and `main.py` as you like.
8. Add your own custom cogs into the `./cog` subdirectory.
9. ???
10. The bot is already working as of 6th step, do whatever you want now.
