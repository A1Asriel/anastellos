# Anastellos Engine

Formerly the AsrielBot's soul, now is used as a modular universal Discord bot engine. It provides easy methods to manage the internals of any bot, as well as some predefined basic commands.


## Quick start (WIP)

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/A1Asriel/anastellos/releases/latest/).
2. Extract it into any directory and create the subdirectory `./anastellos`.
3. Move all the contents from `_extract` to the parent category.
4. Create `token.txt` and insert your bot token into the file.
5. Run `main.py` with your Python interpreter, and close it after it boots.
6. Tweak the stuff in `config.json` and `main.py` as you like.
7. Add your own custom cogs into the `./cog` subdirectory.
8. ???
9. The bot is already working as of 5th step, do whatever you want now.
